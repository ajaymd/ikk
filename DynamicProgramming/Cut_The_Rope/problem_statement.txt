Cut The Rope


Problem Statement:

Given a rope with length n, how should we cut the rope into m parts, with lengths n[0], n[1], ...,n[m - 1], in order to get the maximum product of n[0] * n[1] * ... * n[m - 1]?

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting n.

Output Format:

Return maximum possible product.

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 111
We have to cut at least once. (2 <= m)
Length of the rope, as well as the length of each part are in positive integer value. (i.e. can't do partial cuts.)

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

4

Sample Output:

4

Explanation:

For n = 4, there are two cuts possible: 1 + 3 and 2 + 2.
We'll pick 2 + 2, because their product 2 * 2 = 4 is greater than product of the first one 1 * 3 = 3. 
(So our m = 2, n[0] = 2 and n[1] = 2 and product is n[0] * n[1] = 4.)
