Idea to solve the problem is:
1) First reverse the whole string.
2) Then reverse the individual words.

For example if input is:

s = "Have a nice day!"

1) Then first reverse the whole string, 
s = "!yad ecin a evaH"

2) Then reverse the individual words,
s = "day! nice a Have"







Now have a look at the solution provided by us.








Time Complexity:

O(n).
The first pass over the string is obviously O(n/2) = O(n). The second pass is O(n + combined length of all words / 2) = O(n + n/2) = O(n), which makes this an O(n) algorithm.


Auxiliary Space used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(n).
As space complexity includes the input size also and we have a string in input of length n.
Note that generally we use Auxiliary Space Used = Space Complexity, but there is a different. Auxiliary space does not count the input size but space complexity does.
