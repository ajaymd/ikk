This is an easy question presented with fancy words.





Solution is to iterate over the whole string from left to right and if it is a letter copy it to appropriate place. 

Consider s = "1a2b",
1) '1' -> digit -> skip it -> s = "1a2b".
2) 'a' -> letter -> copy it to appropriate place -> s = "aa2b". (Memory write.)
3) '2' -> digit -> skip it -> s = "aa2b".
4) 'b' -> letter -> copy it to appropriate place -> s = "ab2b". (Memory write.)

Here we have done two memory writes.


We will copy first letter to s[0], second letter to s[1], third letter to s[2] ... So keeping one variable will be enough to know where we should copy the letter. 


Also consider s = "a1b".
1) 'a' -> letter -> copy it to apropriate place -> s = "a1b". (Note that here we will be doing copy s[0] = s[0] but this has no effect, so we can avoid that and save one memory write!)
2) '1' -> digit -> skit it -> s = "a1b"
3) 'b' -> letter -> copy it to appropriate place -> s = "abb". (Memory write.)

Here we have done only one memory write.  


If s has x letters and y digits then answer will be, x letters on the left side (in the same order they appeared in input) followed by y characters same as in input. ("1a2b" -> "ab2b", "a1b" -> "abb")

Now look at the solution provided by us.






Time Complexity:

O(|s|).
As we are traversing through the string.


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(|s|).
As space complexity includes the input size also.
Note that generally we use Auxiliary Space Used = Space Complexity, but there is a different. Auxiliary space does not count the input size but space complexity does.
