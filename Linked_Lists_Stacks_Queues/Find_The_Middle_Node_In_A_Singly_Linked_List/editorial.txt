A typical solution involves computing the length of the list and then traversing exactly half of that. 
A faster approach is to use a slow pointer and a fast pointer, with the faster one traversing twice as fast. 
By the time the fast one reaches the end of the list, the slower one is at the mid-point. This is still O(n) but is faster than previous one.

Have a look at the solution provided by us.





Time Complexity:

O(n).


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(n).
As input is O(n) and auxiliary space used is O(1). So O(n) + O(1) -> O(n).
