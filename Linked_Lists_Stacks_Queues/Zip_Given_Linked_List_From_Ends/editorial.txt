Suppose given a linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL. So zip of this linked list is defined as 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL. 

The task is to achieve desired linked list using O(1) space.
 
This can be performed by a simple algorithm:

Split the list from the middle into two lists. We are splitting the list into two and not creating a new linked list hence maintaining O(1) space.

Now we have two lists : list1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL and list2: 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL. 

Reverse the second list.

This gives us two lists list1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL and list2: 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> NULL.

Now merge the lists picking one node from each list as a time, merged: 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL.





Time Complexity:

O(n).


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(n).
As input is O(n) and auxiliary space used is O(1). So, O(n) + O(1) -> O(n).
