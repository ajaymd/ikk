Have you considered "Try to access linked list nodes minimum number of times."?

If you have done:
1) First find linked list length n.
2) Then find k th node.
3) Then n - k + 1 th node.
4) Swap nodes. 

Then this is not the optimal solution.

Note that while finding length of linked list we could have found the kth node in the same loop!   

Now this is optimal solution. 

Also there is other optimal solution possible and we have presented that in optimal_solution.cpp.






Time Complexity:

O(n).


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1). 


Space Complexity:

O(n).
As input is O(n) and auxiliary space used is O(1). So, O(n) + O(1) -> O(n).
