We have provided two solutions and both solutions contain necessary comments to understand the approach used:

1) brute_force.cpp

Time Complexity:

O(n ^ 2).
As we are transfering all elements of the stack while finding minimum value. 



Auxiliary Space Used:

O(n).
As we are using two extra stacks and one extra vector to store values.  



Space Complexity:

O(n).
As input is O(n) and aixiliary space used is also O(n). So, O(n) + O(n) -> O(n). 



2) optimal_solution.cpp

Time Complexity: 

O(n).
As each operation is performed in constant time and there are total n operations.



Auxiliary Space Used:

O(n). 
As we are using one extra stack and one extra vector to store values.


Space Compelxity:

O(n).
As input is O(n) and aixiliary space used is also O(n). So, O(n) + O(n) -> O(n).
