Have you considered "Solve it with constant extra space."?

If you are using recursion, then it will be O(n / k) extra space due to recursion depth and when k = 1 it will be O(n) extra space!

Have a look at optimal_solution.cpp, it contains necessary comments to understand the solution. 





Time Complexity:

O(n).


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(n).
As input is O(n) and auxiliary space used is O(1). So, O(n) + O(1) -> O(n).
